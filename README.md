# SimpleBingoBoard
This program is a simple bingo board originally created for personal use. It reads a specially created CSV file in order to get the text for the bino board squares. If a bingo(all of one row, column, or diagonal is fully filled) is reached this program will print out that a new bingo has occurred. This behavior can be changed in bingo_board.py. The specially created CSV must contain a column titled "regular space", a column titled "free space", and may contain additional columns. The regular space column contains the text for the squares for the bingo board, and at a minimum must contain enough entries to populate all the squares of the bingo board or you will get an error. The free space column contains the text for the free space square. Any additional columns need a title that is the exact same(case sensitive) as an entry in the regular space column, and when that entry is selected to be in the bingo board it is replaced with a random entry from this column.
